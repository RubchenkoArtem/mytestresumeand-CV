>* _"If you start doing something new, be prepared to be misunderstood. - Jeff Bezos (The founder of Amazon.)"_
>* _"Just work like hell. If others work 40 hours a week, and you work 100 hours, then even doing the same, you will be able to achieve results two and a half times faster. What others will need a year to do, you will be able to do in four months. And if you're lazy, just don't waste time trying to launch your business. - Elon Musk (Engineer, inventor, co-founder of PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla.)"_
